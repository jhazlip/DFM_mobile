Dan Pabon, D-Denver, received a letter from the Colorado County Clerks Association last year expressing the need to revamp the state's elections system, it was music to his ears. </p><p>\"They said what they wanted to work on, and they laid it out for us,\" Pabon, who is the sponsor of an expansive piece of legislation that could change how Coloradans vote, told his House colleagues Thursday.  \"This (letter) was addressed to every senator and every representative in this body.\" </p><p>Pabon's comments sparked a marathon floor debate  Thursday between Democrats and Republicans over a groundbreaking proposal that would send mail ballots to every eligible voter, allow Election Day registration and put all the counties on a real-time statewide database that supporters say would weed out  those who try to vote twice. \r\n</p><p>The Voter Access and Modernized Elections Act  was given initial approval by voice vote on Thursday night and is expected to be up for final approval  Friday.</p><p>The proposal has been decried by state Republicans as a partisan effort by Democrats unwilling to reach across the aisle and work with them. </p><p>Several GOP lawmakers assailed Democrats, saying that because Republican Secretary of State Scott Gessler was excluded from helping draft the measure, it's far from bipartisan. </p><p>\"It's disingenuous to call this bipartisan,\" said House Minority Leader  Mark Waller, R-Colorado Springs. \"I saw this bill for the first time last week.\"</p><p>Pabon noted that  Colorado County Clerks  consists of Republican and Democratic clerks from across the state. </p><p>Among the ins and outs of the measure is the requirement that county clerks and recorders set a minimum number of voter service and polling centers in districts.</p><p>\"That's not right, and it's going to impact everyone regardless of party,\" Waller said Thursday. \"There's a lot of people that still want to go vote at their local polling place.\" </p><p>Democrats, who control both chambers and the governor's office, struck down several amendments by Republicans, saying their concerns were already addressed in the 100-plus-page  bill.   </p><p>   Rep. Carole Murray, R-Castle Rock, and several other GOP lawmakers said the far-reaching bill would, among  other things, open  voter rolls to fraud.</p><p>\"Same-day voter registration would do that,\" said Murray, a former Douglas County clerk. </p><p>Murray added that Colorado was third in voter turnout in 2012, citing a George Mason University study. \"Democrats are acting like Colorado is behind the curve in terms of our voter system, and that's just not true.\"</p><p> Murray stressed it would be impossible  to implement these provisions before the November election — a sentiment shared by Gessler, who staunchly opposes the measure. </p><p> At its core, the Democratic effort  would also get rid of the category of voter inactivity that is triggered when an individual fails to vote in an election and requires Gessler's office to conduct a monthly national change-of-address search on all  voters whose names appear in the statewide voter registration list. </p><p>Gessler has argued that testing the technology involved with some of these initiatives takes time and this measure is \"flawed.\"</p><p>\"And it's an example of bad government,\" Gessler said at a House committee hearing earlier in the week.</p>"

But the dust storms —  eight so far this year and more possibly on the way —  will melt this year's snow faster than last year's, thanks to what Landry described as \"the latent, very acute dust effect that's now inevitable.\"</p><p>There is hope. More snow —  as in several feet piling deep and hiding the latest dust from penetrating sunshine —  could  delay the deluge.</p><p>Water managers across Colorado, many of whom fund Landry's research,  lament the late-season dirt. That dark layer covering even the deepest snowpack prevents the slow and steady runoff that keeps rivers rolling and reservoirs replenished. </p><p>Instead, the runoff comes down at once, forcing precious water that could irrigate fields in July and float rafts in August to run through the state months early.</p><p>\"Snowpack above 9,000 feet is our biggest water storage, and our best reservoir, and we want to keep water in that reservoir as long as possible,\" said Jim Pokrandt with the Colorado River Water Conservation District. \"The worse these dust layers are, you get the snow (disappearing) quicker and that affects late-season base flows in streams. The  effects are felt from high elevation down to where we use the water for irrigation.\"</p><p>Still, Pokrandt noted, at least \"there is more snow to melt,\" especially in the Colorado River Basin, which saw its snow-water-equivalent climb from 72 percent of average in early February to <a href=\"http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/reports/UpdateReport.html?textReport=Upper+Colorado+River+Basin&textRptKey=16&textFormat=SNOTEL+Snow%2FPrecipitation+Update+Report&StateList=Select+a+State&RegionList=16&SpecialList=Select+a+Special+Report&MonthList=April&DayList=18&YearList=2013&FormatList=N0&OutputFormatList=HTML&textMonth=April&textDay=18&CompYearList=select+a+year\" title=\"NRCS Snotel Upper CO  River Basin\" target=\"_blank\"> 97 percent of average after Wednesday's storm.</a></p>"

He then ordered three tellers to clean out their cash drawers.</p><p>\"I am unable to accept that this was an impetuous act,\" Conner said. </p><p>Federal sentencing guidelines required U.S. District Judge William Martinez to imprison Paetsch for seven years for one of the two counts to which he pleaded guilty  — brandishing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence.</p><p>It was Paetsch's first criminal conviction, he didn't hurt anyone and he is remorseful, said Martinez, who  gave him two months for the robbery.</p><p><i>Tom McGhee: 303-954-1671, <a href='mailto:tmcghee@denverpost.com'>tmcghee@denverpost.com</a> or <a href='http://twitter.com/dpmcghee'>twitter.com/dpmcghee</a></i></p>"

              "#cdata-section": "<p>Attorneys for condemned killer Nathan Dunlap are urging the Colorado Court of Appeals to shed light on how an execution would be carried out in Colorado and require public input on the process.</p><p>Dunlap's legal team contends that a Department of Corrections document spelling out details of precisely how an inmate would be executed should be tossed out because it was compiled without public input.</p><p> James Kilroy, one of Dunlap's attorneys, told an appeals court panel earlier this month that the issue boils down to: \"Is CDOC able to establish secret procedures for carrying out death penalty by lethal injection?\"</p><p>Arguing on behalf of the state, Assistant Attorney General Chris Alber said  execution procedures fall under the duties of the DOC director in managing the department. That exempts the document from rules requiring public input, Alber said.</p><p>In an opinion last year,  a Denver District Court judge agreed with that view.</p><p>The document, known as Administrative Regulation 300-14, describes  procedures for carrying out \"the death penalty by lethal injection in a professional, humane and dignified manner ... , \" and much of it is secret, including which drugs would be used to kill Dunlap and the dosage of each.</p><p> <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_22775748/colorado-asks-pharmacists-help-securing-lethal-injection-drug\" target=\"_top\">Just one week before his death</a>, DOC Executive Director Tom Clements sent a note to Colorado pharmacists asking for help securing sodium thiopental, the barbiturate general anesthetic that is used in lethal injections.</p><p>Under state law, the department must carry out executions with \"a lethal quantity of sodium thiopental or other equally or more effective substance sufficient to cause death.\"</p><p>Philip Cherner, another Dunlap attorney, said this week that opening up the process of determining execution protocol is vital to the public's understanding of the death penalty.</p><p>\"We think the public should know what this is all about and have access and input into the process,\" he said.</p><p>Alber said the DOC \"does not concede\" that the public has the right to comment on execution procedures. If there is public interest, then the legislature must create a law that calls for public input, Alber said.</p><p>In 1996 Dunlap was convicted and sentenced to die for killing 17-year-olds Ben Grant and Colleen O'Connor, 19-year-old Sylvia Crowell and 50-year-old Margaret Kohlberg during a 1993 robbery of a Chuck E. Cheese's restaurant in Aurora. He also wounded another employee before making off with about $1,500 in cash and game tokens.</p><p>Dunlap  is now the longest-serving of Colorado's three death-row inmates. Dunlap moved significantly closer to execution in February when the U.S. Supreme Court  <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_22619912/u-s-supreme-court-refuses-hear-death-penalty\" target=\"_parent\">declined to hear his appeal</a>. That cleared the way for an execution date to be set.</p><p>Last week, Arapahoe District Judge William Sylvester scheduled a hearing for May 1 to designate a week during which Dunlap will be executed. Under state law, the final date of the execution is selected by the head of the DOC and must be set between 91 and 120 days from the date of the hearing at which the execution date is set.</p><p><i>Karen Aug&eacute;: 303-954-1733, kauge@denverpost.com or twitter.com/karenauge</i></p>"

A veterinarian examined the horse and found a fractured shoulder that completely paralyzed Levi's leg. </p><p>No one is sure how Levi sustained the injury, but, last Thursday, Ramunda said a veterinarian had to put Levi down, just a week shy of the towering horse's 23rd birthday. </p><p>\"It's beyond words,\" Ramunda said. \"I didn't leave his side.\" </p><p>Ramunda adopted Levi from the Flatirons Equestrian Center, where he went after years working as a carriage horse on the 16th Street Mall in Denver. Ramunda's daughter rode at Flatirons Equestrian, and when the center was looking to sell Levi, she adopted him and kept him at the equestrian center. \r\n\r\n<p><strong>'He touched so many people'</strong> </p><p>For years, Levi roamed the pasture near the corner of 96th Street and Dillon Road in Louisville and became a local fixture. </p><p>\"People knew him from everywhere,\" Ramunda said. \"I've had people calling me. He touched so many people. He was just a beautiful guy, the sweetest guy.\" </p><p>Levi made news last year after the pasture was set to be developed into a new tennis complex. For months, Ramunda tried to find a home big enough for Levi and her other horse -- a quarter horse named Little King. </p><p>Last summer, Bill Hofgard saw a newspaper article about Levi and Little King and emailed Ramunda, offering the barn and 5-acre lot on his property in east Boulder County. </p><p>\"I enjoyed having him here,\" Hofgard said. \"It was sad to see him go. He was a very good horse, very friendly.\" </p><p>Ramunda -- a single mother who made sure to visit the horses every day -- said she was grateful that Levi had a permanent home in his last year. </p><p>\"It's been so great for them to have all that pasture, they love it,\" Ramunda said. \"Bill is so wonderful and his family has been so wonderful. It's been great for them to have all that pasture.\" </p><p>Levi was buried in the pasture he called home for the past year. </p><p>\"He'll always be there,\" Ramunda said. </p><p>She said Little King has not gotten over the death of his friend, and still runs through the pasture neighing and looking for Levi. </p><p>\"It's heartbreaking,\" Ramunda said. \"He stood with him the whole time we were with the vet and stood over him the whole time and didn't leave his side.\" </p><p>Added Hofgard, \"Little King looks like he's lonely.\" \r\n\r\n<p><strong>'My sunshine boy'</strong> </p><p>Hopefully he won't be for long. Ramunda said she already has her eye on another Belgian draft horse up for adoption, and will be going to look at it this weekend. </p><p>\"He can carry on Levi's tradition,\" Ramunda said. \"Bill's thrilled to have another big guy. </p><p>Hofgard agreed, and said he gladly would welcome another horse to join Little King on his pasture. </p><p>\"It would be nice to have another big horse here,\" he said. \"They're no trouble. (Ramunda) takes good care of them.\" </p><p>But while another horse soon may roam the same fields, Ramunda and Hofgard said there will never be another like Levi. </p><p>\"He was very friendly, just a gentle giant,\" Hofgard said. </p><p>Ramunda cited French poet Anatole France, who once said, \"Until one has loved an animal, a part of one's soul remains unawakened.\" </p><p>\"I'll always say, 'He's my sunshine boy,'\" Ramunda said. \"He brought sunshine to my life. He was the love of my life.\" </p><p><em>Contact Camera Staff Writer Mitchell Byars at 303-473-1329 or <a href='mailto:byarsm@dailycamera.com'>byarsm@dailycamera.com</a>.</em></p>"
